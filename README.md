# DS-projects

**1st WEEK:** with acess to a dataset ratings of a prestigious site of instant ramen we aim to gather some answers.<br />
**Questions**: How is ramen manufacturing internationally distributed? How are the ramen ratings distributed per the greater ramen productors? <br />
Is there a relation between the ratings and the product's style?<br />
